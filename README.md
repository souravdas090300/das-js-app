# Pokémon API Project

A RESTful API for accessing and searching Pokémon data. My role was full-stack developer, responsible for designing the API, setting up the database, and implementing endpoints. Key tasks included structuring the data model, handling search/filter logic, and ensuring robust error handling.

**Decisions & Consequences:**  
As the front-end developer, I selected HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to rapidly build an interactive user interface. These technologies enabled quick prototyping and responsive design, ensuring a smooth user experience. I focused on creating intuitive layouts and seamless interactions, prioritizing usability and accessibility throughout the development process.

**Reflections:**  
If I could redo the project, I would invest more time in automated testing and API documentation. I learned the importance of planning data models early and the value of clear, consistent endpoint design.

## Project Materials

Throughout the project, I created and utilized several key materials to guide development and ensure project success:

- **User Stories:** I defined core user needs, such as "As a user, I want to search Pokémon by name, type,height,weight,abilities" to clarify requirements and prioritize features from the user's perspective.
- **Kanban Board:** I organized and tracked tasks using GitHub Issues and Projects, which helped visualize progress, manage workload, and adapt to changing priorities efficiently.
- **User Flows:** I mapped out API request and response cycles to design intuitive endpoints and ensure a smooth experience for both front-end and back-end development.

By actively working with these materials, I maintained a clear development roadmap, stayed focused on user needs, and facilitated effective collaboration and iteration throughout the project.

These materials helped structure development, prioritize features, and maintain focus on user needs throughout the project.
